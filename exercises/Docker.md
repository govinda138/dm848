## Learning Docker

In order to start to understand and get familiar with Docker, a useful train
opportunity is available online on the
[Docker training website](https://training.play-with-docker.com/).

We reccommend to perform the following exercises:
* [Run your first container](http://training.play-with-docker.com/ops-s1-hello/)
* [Docker for beginners - Linux](http://training.play-with-docker.com/beginner-linux/)
* [Docker images](http://training.play-with-docker.com/ops-s1-images/)
* [Docker volumes](http://training.play-with-docker.com/docker-volumes/)

## Next Step

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine.
More instruction, depending on your operating system, are available on the 
official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Create a Dockerfile extending the ubuntu default image and cloning this
repository on the home folder. Then build an image and run a container in
iteractive modality. Try to find out the number of lines where the occourence of
the world Docker appears (hint: use the wc and find commands) in this repository
running the command inside the container.
