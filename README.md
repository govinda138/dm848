# Microservice Programming

This repository contains the public material and information related to the 
[Microservice Programming course](http://odinlister.sdu.dk/Public/Fagbesk?id=11077&listid=1349&lang=en)
offered by the IMADA Department at SDU.

The course is an introduction to microservice programming, a paradigm in which
software is built by composing distributed services that can be independently
developed and deployed. Adopting microservices can offer benefits, among others,
in terms of composability, resilience, and scalability of software projects.
Durning the course, we will use the language
[Jolie](https://www.jolie-lang.org/) as a possible tool for developing
microservice systems. Moreover, we will indulge in the new DevOps software
engineering culture and practice to understand how to automatize and monitor all
steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to
deployment and infrastructure management.

To complete the course you need to complete a presentation on the most modern
tools used by the big players of the IT world and a project where a microservice
system must be build following the DevOps approach.
